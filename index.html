        <h3 id="headline">Some information about the life of Denis Macalister Ritchie:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1941</strong> - Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York. His father was Alistair Ritchie, a Bell Labs veteran.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1967</strong> - After graduating from Harvard University, where he received a bachelor's degree in physics and applied mathematics, Ritchie joined Bell Labs. One of his first serious projects was participation (assistance in the creation of a BCPL language compiler) in the development of Multics, an operating system that implemented the then revolutionary principles of program execution time sharing.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1969</strong> - Bell Labs refuses to participate in the work on Multics and withdraws from the project, citing the lack of financial profit from it as the reason for its actions. Many of the concepts proposed by the specialists of this company remained unrealized or not brought to the end. Shortly after the completion of work on Multics, Bell Labs begins its own project - the UNIX operating system. One of the leading developers is Denis Ritchie. A large number of ideas were implemented in UNIX that did not find application in Multics.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1971</strong> - The first official release of UNIX for PDP-11 computers is released.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1973</strong> - Simultaneously with the start of work on UNIX systems, Ken Thompson and Denis Ritchie developed the B programming language, which is a simplified version of the BCPL language, on whose compiler Denis Ritchie worked on the Multics project. Between 1969 and 1973, the B language was extensively expanded and refined. Denis Ritchie added a new, extended syntax and support for data types. As a result of such improvements, by 1973, a new programming language was actually created, well known to almost all programmers as the C language. The third official version of UNIX in 1973 came out with a built-in C compiler.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1974</strong> - In the fourth version in 1974, the UNIX kernel was rewritten in C, and the fifth version was already completely written in C. Thus, the concept of creating operating systems only in assembly language was destroyed. After UNIX was well established at Bell Labs, installed, and running successfully in several educational, government, and commercial organizations, Steve Johnson, Ken Thompson, and Denis Ritchie ported the system to the new Interdata 8/32 machine platform. This event confirmed the statements of the developers about the possibility of UNIX functioning on various platforms and marked the beginning of its wide distribution.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1995</strong> - Development and release of the first version of the Plan9 operating system.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> - Release of the Inferno operating system.            
          </li>

        <h3>Death and memory:</h3>
        <p>On October 12, 2011, Ritchie was found dead at his home in New Jersey, where he lived alone. The first news of the death was reported by his former colleague Rob Pike: "Dennis Ritchie passed away this weekend at his home." The cause and exact time of death remained unknown. Shortly before that, he was treated for prostate cancer, he also had a heart condition. Ritchie died a week after the death of Steve Jobs, but unlike Jobs, Ritchie's death received little media coverage.</p>
